### **Service Level Objectives and Service Level Indicators **

---

**Definition:**  

Service Level Objectives and Service Level Indicators are foundational concepts within the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) discipline. They provide a framework to measure and ensure the reliability of a system. Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Service Level Indicator (SLI)
An SLI is a specific metric that measures the reliability of a particular aspect of a service. SLIs represent how the system's reliability is experienced by its users. Common SLIs might include:
- **Latency**: The time it takes to respond to a request.
- **Error rate**: The percentage of all requests that produce an error.
- **Availability/uptime**: The percentage of time the service is operational and available to users.
- **Throughput**: The number of requests a system can handle in a given time period.

### Service Level Objective (SLO)
An SLO is a target level of reliability set for an SLI, often represented as a percentage. It provides a clear goal for how often you expect your service to achieve the desired level of reliability. For example:
- An SLO for latency might be "95% of requests should be serviced in under 200ms."
- An SLO for availability might be "99.9% uptime over a 30-day period."

When establishing SLOs, it's crucial to consider user expectations and business needs. Setting the bar too high can result in excessive costs and efforts, while setting it too low can lead to user dissatisfaction.

### Error Budgets
When thinking about SLOs, a related concept is the "error budget." This is the amount of time or number of errors that can occur without violating the SLO. For example, with an availability SLO of 99.9%, there is an error budget of 0.1%, or about 43 minutes in a month, during which the service can be unavailable.

By monitoring SLIs, comparing them against SLOs, and using error budgets, teams can balance the need for feature releases with the necessity for service reliability. This approach provides a quantitative way to make decisions about when to focus on feature development and when to prioritize reliability.
