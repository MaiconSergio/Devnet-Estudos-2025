### **Site Reliability Engineering**

---

**Definition:**  

Site Reliability Engineering is a concept and practice introduced by Google in 2003. It was conceived to address large-scale operational challenges due to the company's rapid growth. Since then, it has become a widely recognized discipline in the tech industry.

**Here are the main points about SRE:**

1. **Definition of SRE**: SRE is an approach to IT operations that combines software engineering and systems techniques with the goal of creating highly reliable and scalable systems.

2. **SRE Engineers**: Instead of traditional system administrators, Google employs SRE engineers, who are essentially software developers with an added interest in system operations, to maintain and scale their massive services.

3. **Error Budget**: One of the key philosophies of SRE is the concept of "error budget". Instead of aiming for 100% availability, SRE acknowledges that systems can and will fail at some point. Therefore, a certain level of unavailability (e.g., 0.1%) is acceptable, allowing for faster innovation without overly compromising stability.

4. **Automation**: SRE emphasizes the importance of automating operational tasks and eliminating manual work through code.

5. **SRE Book**: Google has shared its SRE principles and practices in the "Site Reliability Engineering" book, detailing its approach and methodologies.

6. **Monitoring and Metrics**: One of the core components of SRE is proactive monitoring and metric collection. This helps detect and remediate issues before they impact end-users.

**Conclusion:**  

In summary, SRE represents a cultural and technical shift in how operations are approached in IT organizations, prioritizing reliability, scalability, and efficiency, and using code to manage and automate operations.
